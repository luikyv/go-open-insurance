## Development Setup and Usage Guide

To ensure MockIn works correctly in your local environment, you need to update your system's hosts file. This step allows your machine to resolve the required domains for MockIn.
```bash
127.0.0.1 mockin.local
127.0.0.1 matls-mockin.local
```

This project also includes a series of Makefile targets to streamline the setup, run, and development process. Down below there is a breakdown of the available commands and their purposes.

If you are developing or modifying this project, start by running `make setup-dev`. For this you will need:
* Docker and Docker Compose installed.
* Go 1.22.x installed and properly configured in the development environment.
* Pre-commit installed for managing Git hooks.

Once the setup is complete, youâ€™ll be able to use all other make commands.

If you only need to run the project without modifying it, you can use the simpler setup with `make setup`. For this you only need Docker and Docker Compose installed.
After this setup, you can start the services using `make run` and `make run-with-cs`.

### Setup Commands
`make setup` \
Prepares the environment by generating keys and setting up the Open Insurance Conformance Suite:

`make setup-dev` \
Sets up the development environment by installing pre-commit hooks, generating keys, and setting up the Open Insurance Conformance Suite.

`make setup-cs` \
Clones and prepares the Open Insurance Conformance Suite for use.

### Run Commands
`make run`\
Runs the main MockIn components using Docker Compose.

`make run-with-cs` \
Starts MockIn along with the Open Insurance Conformance Suite.

`make run-dev` \
Runs only the MockIn dependencies necessary for local development. With this command the MockIn server can run and be debugged in the local host.

`make run-dev-with-cs` \
Runs the local development environment with both MockIn and the Conformance Suite. With this command the MockIn server can run and be debugged in the local host with the Conformance Suite.

`make run-cs` \
Starts only the Conformance Suite.

### Utility Commands
`make keys` \
Generates certificates, private keys, and JWKS files for both the server and clients.

`make models` \
Generates API models from the Open Insurance OpenAPI specification.

## TODOs
* Implement user session.
* Generate cs config file.
* Data generators.
* Business.
* Mock calls to the directory.
